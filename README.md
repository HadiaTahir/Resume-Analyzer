# Resume Analyzer

This project focuses on analyzing and extracting key information from resumes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to automate the extraction of relevant data from resumes, such as skills, experience, education, and other key attributes, to streamline the recruitment process.

## Overview

The Resume Analyzer project aims to process and analyze resumes to provide structured and actionable insights. By leveraging NLP and machine learning techniques, this tool helps in identifying candidate qualifications, skills, and experience from unstructured resume data.

## Key Components

- **Data Collection**: The dataset includes resumes in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX). For analysis, resumes are converted into text format using text extraction tools.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The extracted text is preprocessed to handle various tasks such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and normalization. This prepares the text data for further analysis.

- **Feature Extraction**: Key features such as skills, experience, and education are extracted using NLP techniques. Named Entity Recognition (NER), keyword extraction, and pattern matching are utilized to identify relevant information.

- **Model Training**: Machine learning models may be trained to classify or categorize resumes based on extracted features. These models can be used to rank candidates or match resumes to job descriptions.

- **Evaluation**: The performance of the resume analyzer is evaluated based on metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The tool's ability to accurately extract and categorize information is assessed.

- **Visualization**: Extracted information is visualized to provide insights into candidate qualifications. Reports and dashboards are generated to summarize the analysis results.
